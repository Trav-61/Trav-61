Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a hedge-fund operations professional with a passion for Python development. At work, Iâ€™ve built scripts and dashboards to automate workflows and streamline fund operations. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a Russell 3000 index inclusion/exclusion back-test project.

During my studies, I completed several engineering projects using MATLAB, including system simulations and data analysis tools, which strengthened my analytical and coding skills.
